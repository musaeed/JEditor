	I am a young bachelors graduate of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from <a href = "http://www.jacobs-university.de">Jacobs University Bremen</a>, Germany.<br>
	I am developing this JEditor just to learn Java as one of my side projects. So expect some bugs ;) If you see any though, I would appreciate that
	you report them using the suggestions option in the help menu section. If you think that this editor has some potential then feel free to tell me what should i add more to make it more user friendly and more reliable. And to give me some motivation to work, have a look at the donate section of the help menu as well :D
	Feel free to drop by your comments and report any bugs to the above mentioned email address.<br><br><br><br>
